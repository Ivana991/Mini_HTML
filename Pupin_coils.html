           Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called <i></i>"Pupin coils"</i>, followed closely on the pioneering 
           work of the English physicist and mathematician <b>Oliver Heaviside</b>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. 
           The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <em><strong>American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T)</strong></em>, 
           making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development 
           in hand led by <b>George Campbell</b> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid 
           they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of 
           long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
